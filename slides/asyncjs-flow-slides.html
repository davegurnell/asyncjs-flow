Hi everyone.

I'm Dave and I'm here to talk about
static type systems for Javascript:

- What are they?
- Why are they useful?
- How can you start using them in your code?

.footnote[[https://flow.org](https://flow.org)]

???

In particular I'm here to talk about
a static type tool from Facebook called Flow.

I think Flow will be interesting to most people here for two reasons:

1. It's designed to work with regular Javascript projects.
   You can add it to your codebase and
   start using static types gradually.

2. It works nicely with React (which is so hot right now).

---

# Agenda

1. What are static types?
2. Closer look at Flow types
3. Flow command line tools
4. Using Flow with React
5. Bigger picture

---
class: center, middle

# What are static types<br/>(and why should we care)?

???

I want to open by
describing what static types are
and why we should care about them.

First, though, a leading question...

---
class: center, middle

# What is good code?

???

--

- Simple
- Precise
- Predictable

- Maintainable
- Testable
- Composable

---
class: center, middle

# Is this good code?

???

Here's a motivational example.

---
class: center, middle

```js
function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}

var answer = square("2")
```

???

Here's a fragment of code. Answer two questions for me:

1. What does it do?
2. Is the function "good" code?
3. Is the use case "good" code?

--
class: center, middle

```js
answer == 4
```

???

Answer to the first question: `answer` is 4.
Note that it's a number, not a string.

On the subject of whether it's "good" code,
we can make at least three observations.

---
class: center, middle

## The function is intended<br/>to work with numbers

---
class: center, middle

## Its behaviour is poorly defined<br/>when using strings

---
class: center, middle

## We should avoid calling it using strings

---
class: center, middle

## This is a **type error**!

---
class: center, middle

```js
// @flow

function square(n: number): number {
  return n * n;
}

var answer = square("2")
```

.footnote[square.js]

--

```ruby
square.js:7
  7: square("2");
            ^^^ string. This type is incompatible with
                        the expected param type of
  3: function square(n: number): number {
                        ^^^^^^ number
```


---
class: center, middle

```js
// @flow

function square(n: number): number {
  return n * n;
}

var answer = square(2)
```

```ruby
No errors!
```

.footnote[square.js]

---
class: center, middle

# Why care about<br/>static types?

---
class: center, middle

## They prevent bugs

```js
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo'
    of undefined
    at mycode.js:10:20
```

---
class: center, middle

## They document behaviour/intent

```js
function getElementById(id: string): HTMLElement | null {
  // ...
}
```

---
class: center, middle

## They enable worry-free refactoring

```js
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  // ...
}

var answer = add(add(1, 2), 3)
```

.footnote[expr.js]

---
class: center, middle

## They enable worry-free refactoring

```js
function add(a: number, b: number): Expr {
  // ...
}

var answer = add(add(1, 2), 3)
```

.footnote[expr.js]

---
class: center, middle

## They enable worry-free refactoring

```js
function add(a: Expr, b: Expr): Expr {
  // ...
}

var answer = add(add(1, 2), 3)
```

.footnote[expr.js]

---
class: center, middle

## They enable worry-free refactoring

```js
function add(a: Expr, b: Expr): Expr {
  // ...
}

function term(a: number): Expr {
  // ...
}

var answer = add(add(term(1), term(2)), term(3))
```

# Static types are...

Facts we know about code without running it

---
class: center, middle

# Every expression has a type

```js
1 + 1
```

--

```js
"abc" + "def"
```

--

```js
prompt("Enter your name")
```

--

```js
document.getElementById("content")
```

---
class: center, middle

# We can write type annotations

```js
function greaterThan(a: number, b: number): boolean {
  return a > b
}
```

.footnote[annotations.js]

???

We can annotate types in three places:

- Function parameter and return types
- Types of vars, lets, and consts
- Inline type annotations in expressions

(actually there are a couple more places to do with classes and interfaces)

--

```js
var sum: number = 1 + 1
```

--

```js
var str = ("abc" + "def" : string)
```

---
class: center, middle

# Types are removed to produce JS

```js
// @flow

function greaterThan(a: number, b: number): boolean {
  return a > b
}

var sum: number = 1 + 1

var str = ("abc" + "def" : string)
```

.footnote[annotations.js]

---
class: center, middle

# Types are removed to produce JS

```js
//

function greaterThan(a        , b        )          {
  return a > b
}

var sum         = 1 + 1

var str = ("abc" + "def"         )
```

# Flow infers types for us

# However...

- Static types only show *possible* runtime errors
- They won't find *every* error
- They don't remove the need for unit tests

---
class: center, middle

# A closer look at Flow types

---
class: center, middle

## Flow types are...

- a thin layer on top of ES6/7 (with JSX support)
- based on the *structure* of data
- affected by the *flow* of the program
- *completely removed* during compilation
- *completely absent* during runtime

# Primitive types

# The bigger picture

- Static types are a way of verifying properties of your code without running it.
  This is useful for avoiding large classes of bugs
  (e.g. null/undefined references, idiosyncratic corner cases such as `string * string`)

- Static types are weak compared to the full power of the programming language.
  They don't guarantee your code is completely correct.
  However, they do give a lot of safety.
  And you can work with them, using type annotations liberally to maximise safety.

- Earlier I said static types are good for three things:

  - Avoiding bugs
  - Documenting behaviour/intent
  - Simplifying refactoring

  I also believe they are a crucial tool for creating complex programs
  from simple, reliable building blocks.
  The things we need are:

  - Composition
  - Closure
  - Referential transparency (equational reasoning)
  - Static types

- In order to use static types effetively,
  we sometimes need to modify the way we work.
  It's harder to do meta-programming, for example.

- Static types have a bad name because of languages like Java and C#,
  where you have to declare types but the compiler does little to infer them

- However, modern static type systems are not like this.
  Modern compilers infer types to do a lot of the work for you.

- Sophisticated type systems have been around for ages
  in less mainstream languages like Haskell and Scala.

  - We're now seeing these languages gaining in popularity
    because people are beginning to appreciate the power of types
    (see Scala specifically).

  - We're also seeing the rise of static type systems in more familiar-feeling languages:
    Typescript, Elm, Swift, and Flow are great examples of these.

- Because Flow is designed as a checker only,
  it is necessarily limited in what it can do.
  In other languages like Scala, we can use types to drive the compiler.
  We can actually generate code based on types.

```js
function double(n) {
  return n + n;
}

var answer = double("2")
```

???

Notice that we've changed the function
from `n * 2` to `n + n`.

Let's ask the same questions:

1. What does the code do?
2. Is the function "correct"?
3. Is the behaviour what the programmer intended?

--
class: center, middle

```js
answer == "22"
```

???

The answer is `"22"` now,
but this time it's a string.

Again, so we think this is what the programmer intended?

I think we can reasonably say two things about these examples...
